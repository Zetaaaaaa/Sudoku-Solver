# Sudoku Solver

A Sudoku solver implemented in Python using recursive backtracking. This project includes a visualization of the solving process, allowing users to see how the algorithm attempts to fill the Sudoku board and backtracks when necessary.

## Features

- Solves a given Sudoku puzzle using recursive backtracking.
- Visualizes the solving process dynamically, showing each step of the algorithm.
- Prints the original and solved Sudoku boards in a user-friendly format.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zetaaaaaa/sudoku-solver.git
   cd sudoku-solver

2. Run the script
   ```bash
   python sudoku_solver.py

3. The program will display the original Sudoku puzzle and visualize the solving process in the console.

NOTE: The default Sudoku puzzle used in the script is:
```markdown
3 0 6 | 5 0 8 | 4 0 0
5 2 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 0
0 8 7 | 0 0 0 | 0 3 1
---------------------
0 0 3 | 0 1 0 | 0 8 0
9 0 0 | 8 6 3 | 0 0 5
0 5 0 | 0 9 0 | 6 0 0
---------------------
1 3 0 | 0 0 0 | 2 5 0
0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 7 4
0 0 5 | 2 0 6 | 3 0 0
```
Here every 0 represents an empty space.
Feel free to change the puzzle or make it user-input friendly.

Happy coding :)
